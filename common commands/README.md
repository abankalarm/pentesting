passwd- to change password

whoami - to show privelege level

/bin - basic programs (ls, cd, cat, etc.)

/sbin - system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, etc)

/etc - configuration files

/tmp - temporary files (typically deleted on boot)

/usr/bin - applications (apt, ncat, nmap, etc.)

/usr/share - application support and data files

man - to see manual of a tool

man -k passwd - -k to search for a specific tool

man -k ^passwd$^ - here ^ ^ is to match entire line and $ to prevent substring matches

apropos keyword - helps to search description of man page

ls -al - a is to show hidden files aswell

pwd - to show the current directory

which - searches through directories for path environment

locate - to locate

find / -name sbd* - to find names starting with sbd ( benifits over locate as more filters)

apt-cache search displays info about internal cached package database

apt remove --purge - purge removes everything

dpkg - it is a tool to directly install .debian packages

echo $APATH - shows path environment variable

echo $USER

echo $PWD - present working directory

echo $HOME - home directory

we can also define path using export

export b = 10.10.10.1 - this allows us to repeatedly refer to the ip adress without writing it again and again

echo "$$" - to show process id

env - see default env variables by using env

history - to check bash history and then preceeded by      !1 or any other option

!! - shows last command executed

## piping and redirection

every command run has 3 streams.
STDIN   filedescriptor 0
STDOUT  1
STDERR  2

piping using | or < or > connects these streams between programs

command > text.txt

to append to an existing file(add data)

command >> text.txt

we can also redirect from a file

wc -m < redirect.txt

ls ./test>error.txt - to redirect the error


## grep

ls -la /usr/bin | grep zip
here we piped two commands together

grep has -r for recursive searching and -i to ignore text case

## sed 

sed is stream edior
echo "this is og stf here" | sed 's/stf/stuff'
> this is og stuff here

## cut 
a simple command used to extract sections of text -f for field no. we are cutting -d for field delimeter

e.g. 
kali@kali:~$ echo "I hack binaries,web apps,mobile apps, and just about anything else"
| cut -f 2 -d ","

web apps

kali@kali:~$ cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd

>root

>daemon

>bin

here a list users is extracted from /etc/passwd

## awk

awk is a programming language for text processing

echo "hello::there::friend" | awk3-F "::" '{print $1, $3}'
> hello friend

## head 
displays first 10 lines

## wc 
with -l displays the no. of lines

## nano

my favourite tool lmao 

## vi
dd- delete current line

yy- copy current line

p - to paste clipboard

x - delete current char

:w to write to a file

:q! quit without writing to disk

:wq save and quit

## comm
 to compare two text files
 easy interface
 
## diff
same as comm but much more complex

-c include context format

-u unified format

```

 ## vimdiff
 
 opens vim in different tbas for multiple files
 
 vimdiff a.txt b.txt
 
 ## backgrounding a process
 $ after a command immediately backgrounds the process
 
 ## jobs
 
 lists current jobs running in the current terminal
 
 ## fg 
 
 returns a process to foreground
 First, the odd ^C character represents the keystroke combination
. We can use this shortcut
to terminate a long-running process and regain control of the terminal.
C c
Second, the use of “%1” in the fg %1 command is new. There are various ways to refer to a job in
the shell. The “%” character followed by a JobID represents a job specification.

## ps and kill

process status and kill
 
 ```
 kali@kali:~$ ps -ef
UID       PID         PPID C STIME TTY    TIME CMD
root        1             0 0 10:18 ?    00:00:02 /sbin/init
...
Listing 62 Common ps syntax to list all the processes currently running
The -ef 73 options we used above stand for:
• e : select all processes
• f : display full format listing (UID, PID, PPID, etc.)
Finding our Leafpad application in that massive listing is definitely not easy, but since we know the
application name we are looking for, we can replace the -e switch with -C (select by command
name) as follows:
kali@kali:~$ ps -fC leafpad
UID       PID     PPID C STIME TTY  TIME CMD
kali      1307     938 0 10:57 ?    00:00:00 leafpad
 ```
 
 
 kill 1307 to stop leafpad
 
 
# file and command monitoring

## tail

to monitor log entries as they are being written
For example,
we may want to monitor the Apache logs to see if a web server is being contacted by a given client
we are attempting to attack via a client-side exploit. This example will do just that:
kali@kali:~$ sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

The -f option (follow) is very useful as it continuously updates the output as the target file grows.
Another convenient switch is -nX , which outputs the last “X” number of lines, instead of the default
value of 10.
