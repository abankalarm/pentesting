nstead we try to check for the robots.txt file and, as a result, the message “You are not a search engine!” is shown. You can’t read my robots.txt!

Without wasting time, I try to bypass this restriction by editing a new user agent in my firefox using the following steps:

    Inside the URL tab search for “about:config”
    Then search for preference Name: useragnet
    Make a right click then > New > String

You get a dialog box; enter the preference name “general.useragent.overriide” as shown in the below image.

Enter the string value to provide useragent “GoogleBot”.
