in burp suite

Only .txt and .rtf extensions were allowed. After an exhaustive list of ways to upload any kind of shell but we were unsuccessful. Now it hit us that we could try command injection through this upload option. We tried the very basic injection with “;whoami”. For this we intercepted the request on the “Upload!” and added the injection text in the filename field as shown in the image given below. After this, we forwarded the request to the Target Machine Server.
