## nmap

n Kali, the NSE scripts can be found in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory. Opening any of
the *.nse files in a text editor shows the source of each script in a simple human-readable format.
Take time to review some of the NSE scripts to get familiar with the format and the types of checks
these scripts perform.
This folder also contains a script.db file that serves as an index to all of the scripts. It also
categorizes each of the Nmap scripts. We could, for example, use the file to grep for scripts in the
“vuln” and “exploit” categories


Let’s try to use the NSE to detect a vulnerability. For this example, we will use --script vuln to
run all scripts in the “vuln” category against a target in the PWK labs:

kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap --script vuln 10.11.1.10
