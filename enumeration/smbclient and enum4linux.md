The first thing we need to do is determine if SMB is present on the target. It's usually a safe bet that if ports 139 and 445 are open, SMB is running.

## enum4linux

enum4linux -U 10.10.0.50
The most basic usage of Enum4linux takes an option and the IP address of the target. We can use the -U flag to view users on the target:

The -S flag will give us information about the SMB shares on the machine

We can use the -o flag to get some operating system information:
If the target is a domain controller, the -l flag will attempt to get some limited information about LDAP running on the server:

Printers are often shared on a network and can often be an overlooked attack vector. We can use the -i flag to view any printer information:

Perhaps the most useful option for this tool is the option to run all these tests at once. That way we can quickly get all the SMB information we need in one scan â€” use the -a flag to run all simple enumeration:

## Use Smbclient to List Shares & Transfer Files

Smbclient is a tool used to access SMB resources on a server, much like an FTP client is used to access files. It offers a simple command-line interface that is trivial to use if you're at all familiar with FTP.

sudo smbclient -N \\\\10.10.10.27\\backups
