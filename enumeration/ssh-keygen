Now time to generate some ssh keys, thus we used ssh-keygen to generate ssh public keys without password in our local machine 
i.e. KALI LINUX. Moving on after the key is created, we moved into the .ssh directory on our native shell, here we saw that 
we have the key named “id_rsa.pub”.

With the help of above-enumerated creds “smbuser:rootroot1” we logged into FTP and create a folder as .ssh inside /home/smbuser,
then try to upload the id_rsa.pub which we have generated in above mention step as authorized_keys  inside the .ssh directory.
