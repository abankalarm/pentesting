The Simple
Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) 216 supports several interesting commands, such as VRFY and
EXPN. A VRFY request asks the server to verify an email address, while EXPN asks the server for
the membership of a mailing list. These can often be abused to verify existing users on a mail
server, which is useful information during a penetration test. Consider this example:

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nv 10.11.1.217 25
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.217] 25 (smtp) open
220 hotline.localdomain ESMTP Postfix
> VRFY root
252 2.0.0 root
```
