DOM-based open-redirection vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into a sink that can trigger cross-domain navigation. For example, the following code is vulnerable due to the unsafe way it handles the location.hash property:

```

let url=/https?:\/\/.+/.exec(location.hash)
    if(url) {
        location = url[0];
    }
```

An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause a redirection to an arbitrary external domain.

The following are some of the main sinks can lead to DOM-based open-redirection vulnerabilities:
```
location
location.host
location.hostname
location.href
location.pathname
location.search
location.protocol
location.assign()
location.replace()
open()
domElem.srcdoc
XMLHttpRequest.open()
XMLHttpRequest.send()
jQuery.ajax()
$.ajax()```
