arises when website takes userinput directly and stores it in eval() or inner html


A source is a JavaScript property that accepts data that is potentially attacker-controlled. 
An example of a source is the location.search property because it reads input from the query string,
which is relatively simple for an attacker to control. Ultimately, any property that can be controlled by the
attacker is a potential source. This includes the referring URL (exposed by the document.referrer string), 
the user's cookies (exposed by the document.cookie string), and web messages. 


IMPORTANT
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
<script></script>
<submit onlclick>

 The innerHTML sink doesn't accept script elements on any modern browser, nor will svg onload events fire. This means you will need to use alternative elements like img or iframe. Event handlers such as onload and onerror can be used in conjunction with these elements. For example:

element.innerHTML='... <img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)> ...' 


If a framework like AngularJS is used, it may be possible to execute JavaScript without angle brackets or events. When a site uses the ng-app attribute on an HTML element, it will be processed by AngularJS. In this case, AngularJS will execute JavaScript inside double curly braces that can occur directly in HTML or inside attributes. 
anagular js {{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}


JavaScript replace() function to encode angle brackets. However, when the first argument is a string, the function only replaces the first occurrence. We exploit this vulnerability by simply including an extra set of angle brackets at the beginning of the comment. These angle brackets will be encoded, but any subsequent angle brackets will be unaffected, enabling us to effectively bypass the filter and inject HTML.
