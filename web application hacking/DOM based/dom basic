arises when website takes userinput directly and stores it in eval() or inner html


A source is a JavaScript property that accepts data that is potentially attacker-controlled. 
An example of a source is the location.search property because it reads input from the query string,
which is relatively simple for an attacker to control. Ultimately, any property that can be controlled by the
attacker is a potential source. This includes the referring URL (exposed by the document.referrer string), 
the user's cookies (exposed by the document.cookie string), and web messages.
