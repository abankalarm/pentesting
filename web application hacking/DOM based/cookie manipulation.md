Some DOM-based vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate data that they do not typically control. This transforms normally-safe data types, such as cookies, into potential sources. DOM-based cookie-manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into the value of a cookie.

An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will set an arbitrary value in the user's cookie. Many sinks are largely harmless on their own, but DOM-based cookie-manipulation attacks demonstrate how low-severity vulnerabilities can sometimes be used as part of an exploit chain for a high-severity attack. For example, if JavaScript writes data from a source into document.cookie without sanitizing it first, an attacker can manipulate the value of a single cookie to inject arbitrary values:

document.cookie = 'cookieName='+location.hash.slice(1);
