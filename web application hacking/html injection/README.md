  2. post
   we have a login form, which is vulnerable to HTML attack. Data typed in the login form is being sent with POST method. Then,   if we would type any HTML code instead of the correct parameters, then it will be sent with POST method and displayed on the    website.

    To perform Reflected POST HTML attack, it is recommended to use a special browser’s plugin, that will fake the sent data. One of it is Mozilla Firefox plugin “Tamper Data”. The plugin takes over the sent data and allows the user to change it. Then changed data is being sent and displayed on the website.
