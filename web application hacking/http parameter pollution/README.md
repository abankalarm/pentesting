On the blog page, when HackerOne rendered a link to share
on Facebook, the link would become the following:
https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://hackerone.com/blog/introducing
-signal?&u=https://vk.com/durov


Attackers could also
manipulate this text by including &text= in the URL, like this:
https://hackerone.com/blog/introducing-signal?&u=https://vk.com/
durov&text=another_site:https://vk.com/durov
