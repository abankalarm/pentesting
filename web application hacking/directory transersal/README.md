....//....//....//etc/passwd
You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/, which will revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.

You might be able to use various non-standard encodings, such as ..%c0%af or ..%252f, to bypass the input filter.

if an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as /var/www/images, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example:

filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must end with an expected file extension, such as .png, then it might be possible to use a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example:

filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
